Update 3.5 years in: still love it, use it all the time, no problems.

For a long time, I wasn't a believer. If I want to cook something for hours until its delicious and tender, I've got a traditional slow cooker. If I want to feel fancy when I'm preparing perfectly-cooked meats, I've got my Anova sous vide, and a wireless meat thermometer for the grill.

Eventually, though, there was a sale, and I bought one. Now, I didn't really have any meaningful concept of the differences between the sizes and models. This 8 quart Duo Plus came up as a daily deal thing, and I bought it. It was a good price. And you know, it can make like 2 gallons of yogurt or porridge or something.

I'll be the first to admit that I didn't count on the sheer size of the thing. When I unboxed this 8-quart monstrosity, I experienced a moment of trepidation, a fear of ridicule from my wife, who would point out that we don't need a really really ridiculously huge pressure cooker for just us. 

The first time each of us used it, we felt what I'm sure every other pressure cooker rookie feels at first-the crippling fear that you're about to die in a horrific high-pressure home explosion, and that your family will always be embarrassed to explain that they were related to one of _those_ statistics. 

And it didn't take long before we realized (my wife especially, since she does a lot of the cooking) how fantastic this giant culinary autoclave really is. Cook an entire dinner of roast chicken with red beans & rice in one go? Done. Steam a whole mess 'o veggies when some friends show up with their gaggle of kids for dinner? Easy. Meatballs. Tamales. Artichokes. Corn on the cob. And there's just a single pot to scrub at the end! 

Last night I think I reached my true peak of giant Instant Pot appreciation. I cooked two racks of BBQ pork back ribs. I thought about just taking the meat to my dad's house and letting him do them in the smoker. But that would have taken like 10 hours! I could have tried the sous vide, but that would required me to cut up the ribs into ziploc-sized portions, to come up with a way to cook that much meat together in a bigger cooler than I usually use, and to then clean up the mess and cook for at least a few hours to get a good texture. And who has that kind of time when there's football to be watched and naps to be taken? Want to know how long I spent preparing this meal in the Instant Pot?
- Five minutes unwrapping and rubbing the meat and stuffing it all into my countertop sauna. I'll leave the visualization to you.
- Twenty minutes as the Instant Pot got up to cooking pressure.
- 25 minutes cooking + 2 minutes decompressing (and filling the house with delicious porky aroma)
- Five minutes painting on some sauce and letting everything sizzle on the grill.

Seriously. Delicious, perfectly cooked barbecue ribs-enough to feed at least eight people-ready in about an hour.

So yeah. I'm a fan. And even though it's comically large when we're just cooking for ourselves, I'm glad I got the 8 qt monster after all. I haven't even explored all of the fancy other options and space-age things it can do. But I will. If only because I can. Thanks, Instant Pot! <insert smile with tooth sparkle and "ding" sound>
